## About

This is my Corne (Rev1) keyboard keymap that modifies the QMK Firmware to create my work layout. 

Feel free to fork the project to customize the layout based on your own preferences.

## How to use?

After [setting up your QMK build enviromnet](https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/tutorial/newbs_getting_started#setting-up-your-qmk-environment), you can flash your Corne by placing the project's source files in `~/qmk_firmware/keyboards/crkbd/U-ways` (or you can create your own user directory), and then running the command:

```
qmk flash -kb crkbd/rev1 -km U-ways
```
